            craftsman, programmer, and dreamer. Lujie Zhao (赵璐洁) has been making significant contributions to the technology landscape from her base in Seattle. Having journeyed from China to the United States for high school at age of 16, Zhao has since established herself as a rising talent in the software engineering field.

        <h3 class="f3 fw7 lh-title mt0 mb2 bb pb2 b--black-20">THE GOOGLE YEARS</h3>
        <h4 class="f5 fw7 lh-title mt0 mb2">Building Security at Scale</h4>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          Today, Zhao works at the forefront of cloud security at Google, contributing to systems that protect some of the world's most critical infrastructure. Her role in the Cloud Security division places her at the intersection of cutting-edge security research and practical, scalable solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          But her relationship with Google began years earlier. In Summer 2020, while still a student, she earned a spot in Google's highly competitive 
          <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/" class="b no-underline hover-bg-gold black-80">
            STEP (Student Training in Engineering Program)
          </a>
          —a program designed to identify and nurture early-career talent from diverse backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          Working under the Google Cloud Core Infrastructure team, Zhao developed sophisticated data visualization tools for configuration pushes—systems that help engineers monitor and manage deployments across Google's massive cloud infrastructure. The work required not just technical prowess, but the ability to translate complex data into actionable insights.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          Her performance impressed leadership enough to earn a return offer. The following summer, she joined the Google Cloud Identity team as a full Software Engineer Intern, where she implemented public APIs for Google Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service—critical components that millions of developers rely on to secure their applications.

      <div class="newspaper-column">
        <h3 class="f3 fw7 lh-title mt0 mb2 bb pb2 b--black-20">THE NYU CHAPTER</h3>
        <h4 class="f5 fw7 lh-title mt0 mb2">Triple Focus, Singular Vision</h4>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          Zhao's academic journey at New York University showcased her interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving. Graduating in December 2021 with a B.S. in Computer Science, she didn't stop there—she pursued double minors in Mathematics and Finance, recognizing that the most innovative solutions often emerge at the intersection of multiple fields.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          Her most ambitious project during her NYU years was the complete rebuilding of the 
          <a href="https://eg.poly.edu/" class="b no-underline hover-bg-gold black-80">
            course website
          </a>
          for the Introduction to Engineering course. What started as a simple update evolved into a ground-up reconstruction of the entire platform.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          The challenge was substantial: the course served over 1,000 students daily, and the system needed to be reliable, scalable, and intuitive. Zhao architected a solution that not only met these requirements but became a model for other course platforms at the university.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          "It taught me that engineering isn't just about writing code—it's about understanding your users, anticipating their needs, and building systems that just work," she notes.
        </p>

      <div class="newspaper-column">
        <h3 class="f3 fw7 lh-title mt0 mb2 bb pb2 b--black-20">BEYOND THE CODE</h3>
        <h4 class="f5 fw7 lh-title mt0 mb2">A Craftsman's Philosophy</h4>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          Zhao describes herself as a "craftsman, programmer, and dreamer"—three identities that inform her approach to software engineering. The craftsman values precision and quality. The programmer solves complex technical challenges. The dreamer envisions what's possible beyond current constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          This philosophy extends to her work in cloud security, where she balances the competing demands of robust protection, user experience, and system performance.
        </p>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          Her diverse background—from her cross-cultural journey to her interdisciplinary education—gives her a unique perspective in an industry that increasingly values varied viewpoints. As cloud computing and AI reshape how we build and secure systems, engineers like Zhao, who can bridge technical depth with broad contextual understanding, are becoming invaluable.
        </p>
        <h4 class="f5 fw7 lh-title mt3 mb2">What's Next</h4>
        <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-narrow">
          With several years at Google under her belt and a track record of delivering high-impact projects, Zhao continues to push boundaries in cloud security and infrastructure. Her journey from a sixteen-year-old newcomer to a respected engineer at one of the world's most influential tech companies exemplifies what's possible with determination, continuous learning, and the courage to take that first bold step.
